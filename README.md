##  Features
- **Step-by-step explanations** with both theory and hands-on code.
- **Well-commented Python cells** for clarity and easy learning.
- **Visualizations** of quantum circuits, Bloch spheres, and measurement histograms.
- **Practical examples** covering:
  - Installing and importing Qiskit
  - Quantum vs. classical computing
  - Complex numbers, vectors, and bra–ket notation
  - Building and simulating circuits
  - Single-qubit and multi-qubit gates
  - Measurement and probabilities
  - Famous quantum algorithms: Deutsch–Jozsa, Grover’s Search, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
  - Running on real IBM Quantum devices
